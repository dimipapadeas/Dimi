##    TODO CHECK AGAIN...
       Automatic Weather Station
    Mouktar is keen to automate the collection of data so that he can receive more regular observations- once per hour. 
  
    Mouktar ask Omar to create a new queue for this AWS. As this raw data is not intended to be publicly available, there is no need to publish Web pages for commercial search engines to crawl, nor for the AWS data to be registered with the Authoritative WIS Catalogue.

    QControl script:
     subscribes to the data from the queue, and checks the values. If an erroneous value is detected, an email is sent to Mouktar notifying him of the anomaly, 
     else the script places the data on the 
     ** official queue **
      for observation data from Assa Ga√Øla, which is then automatically propagated to other subscribers (such as Mariam) and to the CSV dataset.
